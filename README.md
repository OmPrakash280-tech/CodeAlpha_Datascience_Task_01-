**Titanic Survival Prediction**

This project aims to build a predictive model that determines whether a person would survive the Titanic disaster. The model uses various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more to predict survival chances.

**Overview**

The Titanic disaster is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. Predicting the survival of passengers can be an interesting and insightful exercise in data analysis and machine learning. This project explores the Titanic dataset to identify key factors influencing survival rates and builds a classification model to predict the survival of passengers.

**Features**

* Data Analysis: Detailed exploration of the Titanic dataset to understand the impact of different factors on survival rates.
* Data Visualization: Graphical representation of the distribution of survival based on socio-economic status, age, gender, etc.
* Machine Learning Model: Implementation of various classification algorithms to predict survival.
* Feature Importance: Analysis to determine which features most significantly affect the likelihood of survival.


**Technologies Used**

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
